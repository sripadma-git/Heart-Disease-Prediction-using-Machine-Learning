Project Overview: Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning ❤️💻
<br>
Objective:
<br>
The goal of the project is to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various health-related features. This is a binary classification problem, where the target variable is the presence or absence of heart disease (0 or 1).
<br>
Key Steps Involved:
<br>
Data Collection 📊:
<br>
The dataset used is from Kaggle, titled Heart Disease UCI by Ronit F. It contains various features like age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health metrics.

<br>

Data Preprocessing 🔧:
<br>

Handling missing values (if any)
<br>
Scaling the features for algorithms that require it (e.g., KNN, SVM)
<br>
Encoding categorical variables (if applicable)
<br>
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
<br>
Model Selection 🧠:
<br>
Various machine learning algorithms were tried, including:
<br>

1.Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn): A simple model to predict binary outcomes using a logistic function.
<br>
2.Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn): Based on Bayes' theorem, assumes features are conditionally independent given the class.
<br>
3.Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Linear) (Scikit-learn): Finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes.
<br>
4.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (Scikit-learn): Classifies based on the majority vote of the nearest neighbors.
<br>
5.Decision Tree (Scikit-learn): Builds a model by recursively partitioning the feature space.
<br>
6.Random Forest (Scikit-learn): An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.
<br>
7.XGBoost (Scikit-learn): A powerful boosting algorithm that builds models sequentially to improve accuracy.
<br>
8.Artificial Neural Network (Keras): A deep learning model with one hidden layer to predict heart disease.
<br>
Model Evaluation 🏅:
<br>
Each model was evaluated on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 95%.
<br>
Results and Insights 📈:
<br>
Best performing model: Random Forest (achieved 95% accuracy) 🌟
<br>
Other models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree also performed reasonably well but with slightly lower accuracy.
<br>

Data preprocessing is crucial for the performance of machine learning models. Scaling the data and handling missing values appropriately can significantly improve results.
<br>
Random Forest was the best-performing algorithm for this dataset, yielding an accuracy of 95%. This makes sense since Random Forest is a powerful ensemble method that can handle high-dimensional datasets well.
<br>
Other models like Logistic Regression and SVM also performed well but were outperformed by Random Forest.
<br>
Future Work 🚀:
<br>
Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the models to further improve accuracy.
<br>
Exploring deep learning techniques (e.g., more complex neural networks) might be an interesting direction.
<br>
Analyzing feature importance (especially with Random Forest and XGBoost) could provide insights into the most significant predictors for heart disease.
